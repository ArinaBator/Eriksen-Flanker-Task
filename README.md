## General info

This procedure is based on one of the contemporary versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. In this version, participants are shown 1 or 5 arrows (instead of letters as in the original version) in a single row, and the primary task of the participant is to react as quickly as possible (by pressing the appropriate key on the keyboard - the left arrow key if the middle arrow is pointing to the left or the right arrow key if the middle arrow is pointing to the right).

## Notes 
The project includes instructions for participants in Polish. The names of the result folder and result files are also in Polish.

To exit the experiment during a session, press F7.
